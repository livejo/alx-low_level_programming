	Dynamic Libraries
	
Dynamic linking and Dynamic Libraries Dynamic Linking doesnâ€™t require the code to be copied, it is done by just placing name of the library in the binary file. The actual linking happens when the program is run, when both the binary file and the library are in memory. Examples of Dynamic libraries (libraries which are linked at run-time) are, .so in Linux and .dll in Windows.
